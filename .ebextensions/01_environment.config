### Additional Configuration

You may need to configure your Elastic Beanstalk environment to handle specific requirements, such as environment variables, database connections, or scaling policies. You can do this using the Elastic Beanstalk console or by creating a `.ebextensions` directory in your project with configuration files.

### Example `.ebextensions` Configuration

Create a directory named `.ebextensions` in the root of your project and add a configuration file, for example, `01_environment.config`:

```yaml
option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
    NODE_ENV: production
    PORT: 5001
